# PCB manufacturing

## Create the pcb on EasyEDA

## Export it as svg (2.5x, upper layer, board contours, multilayer, holes - black on white)

## Open it with an image editing software to remove the white countour and leave only whats inside the board contours. Don't forget to mirror the circuit if you are using a one-sided copper clad, otherwise you can't solder the components

## save it as png or jpg
https://pixlr.com/it/

## convert from png/jpg back to svg
https://convertio.co/it/

## svg to stl
https://svg2stl.com/download/62ff87d2e13a861160a4098c

## mirror the stl vertically

## score the board once finished to remove unwanted connections
